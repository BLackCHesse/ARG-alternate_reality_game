WELCOME_dear viewer if you going to play this game you are expecting your soul will be filled or "posesed" by something. be calm. it's just a game and all i'm presenting to you key_to portal, portal that get's you in other dimensions. but be sure this reality is far greater in details then any alternate reality. all i'm presenting to you is creativity.
it's like matrix pill, no mather what you choose all that i'm offering is the truth. 
let's start. how will you look at an object far far away from you ? is it just a picture you can't work with? or you can still play with that object. how? take a piece of paper and hide it_or take a photo and change it in your phone. imagine this
you are in a world which you can't change. unless you do hardwork. but imagine this. you are in world full of giants and dwarfs. if you are giant it doesn't mean everything is easy_to you and if you are dwarf it still doesn't mean everything is hard to you.
comunication and creativity can move worlds. imagine you are a god. incredible thinker but not fyzical. you can create anything out of thin air but how? by laws bugs and information. if you can create something out of thin air like sound, waves or information you have all resources to communicate with other informations. basicly speaking imagine one person fully using it's power. now imagine you can duplicate yourself but you can't send all info you got. all you can do is create enviroment suitable for it's life. the origin of this person can be shaped but by changing it's reality.
